# QuizGame
This game in Python utilizes object-oriented programming (OOP) to create a trivia quiz. Each time you play, it is a fresh set of questions through Open Trivia Database. 


Updated: Added a ui.py with class GUI to enhance user experience with an interactive GUI that flashes red when you get it wrong and green when you get it right(all T/F questions). I updated main.py and quiz_brain.py in accordance. Also, I updated the way I called the API to include parameters for better flexibility and used html.unescape to clean up that data.
